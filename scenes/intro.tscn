Truth and lies.

Knowledge and ignorance.

Life and death. 

Conceptual duality, revered for as long as aged Time can remember.

Binary stars dancing among the lights of an uncertain sky.

Kindness and Hatred, flitting about the horizon, fleeting and eternal.

A memory of that which Man has reaped for Itself.

What does Man seek, and what does It ignore?

What will Man find, and what has It lost?

What does Man know, and what has It forgotten?

Perhaps these questions may never truly be answered.

But after time immemorial, the accursed dichotomy acts upon a whim.

Cosmic lights shed a spark to bear duality's haunting name.

And that name is ----
